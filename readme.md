# SUBSTITUTION CIPHER
In cryptography, a substitution cipher is a method of encrypting in which units of plaintext are replaced with the ciphertext, in a defined manner, with the help of a key. - Wikipedia

This project was originally part of a problem set from CS50's Introduction to Computer Science, with expansions in scope and functionality including decryption.

With a 26-letter encryption key provided by the user, the program is able to cipher plaintext and uncipher scrambled text.

## HOW TO RUN
1. Obtain a 26-letter encryption key, containing **26 unique alphabets** in any order, case-insensitive. (e.g. thdfwzmlunraobxgjvpyqceski)
2. In your terminal's command-line, enter 'make ciphertext'.
3. Then, enter './ciphertext key', including your chosen 26-letter key as 'key'. (e.g. ./ciphertext thdfwzmlunraobxgjvpyqceski)
4. Follow terminal prompts.
